## Welcome to Qubes Users Berlin!

We are a group of [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org) users who meet monthly in Berlin. 

# Monthly meetings

We virtually meet every **second** Tuesday of the month.

Pre-pandemic we met at [xHain](https://x-hain.de/de/page/calendar/), a hackerspace at **Gr√ºnberger Str. 16** in Friedrichshain.

We will met virtually until the coronavirus pandemic is over and xHain re-opens.
