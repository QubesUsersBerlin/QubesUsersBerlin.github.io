- Give i3 a try with an example setup 

Sinni talked about their setup with a follow up discussion <3 !


## 25.4.2025

We did discuss some pretty cool topics: preloaded disposable qubes, salted site-specific browser qubes & Android in Qubes OS:

1. We got a peak into a very exciting Qubes OS feature in development by [Ben](https://github.com/ben-grande) - [preloaded disposable qubes](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1512)
2. Salted site-specific browser qubes revisited by Corey [see](https://github.com/coyotebush/qubes-salt/tree/web) 
3. Discussion & further collaborations on site regarding Android on Qubes OS inspired by the forum [post](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/use-android-apps-in-qubesos/32971) by norkelcake and bae9e4f7 
4. GrapheneOS - apart from syncing the repo and building for emulator nothing much :) wip - play with kernel parameters with the notable warning that this disregards security features. GrapheneOS Team has [plans](https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/113185686714810236) though :)

## 28.3.2025

We looked at some Salt and Android use cases in Qubes OS:

- Salted site-specific browser qubes!
  - Corey talked about salting a web qube and also shared his [repo](https://github.com/coyotebush/qubes-salt)! We will continue the discussion in April!
- Android Use Cases in Qubes OS
  - We continued the engaging discussion from our last meetup. snorkelcake and bae9e4f7 wrote a guide for how to setup an android qube which is available on the [forum](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/use-android-apps-in-qubesos/32971).
